I'm Hayden Plumley, a tech enthusiast who's all about tinkering with electronics, watching horror movies, and making the perfect cup of espresso. When I'm not wrapped up in those pursuits, I'm likely writing code for my projects on GitHub (and sometimes others). Currently, I'm learning Python to enhance my application/tool, Fire-Tools, and expand my coding skills. Professionally, I excel in collaborative environments, boasting excellent problem-solving skills and a keen attention to detail.
