Winget is a package manager based off [Keivan Beigi's AppGet](https://keivan.io/the-day-appget-died/), its goal is to be a "one-stop shop" to install all your Windows programs. It achieves this by having a central repository of installation scripts for all of your favorite applications such as Discord, Spotify, and Steam. ~~Currently, Winget has to be manually installed, but later it should come bundled with Windows.~~

## Windows Store Method

Direct Link to Winget (AppInstaller) in Windows Store:

- [View in Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NBLGGH4NNS1&mode=mini)
