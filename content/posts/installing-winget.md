Winget is a package manager based offÂ [Keivan Beigi's AppGet](https://keivan.io/the-day-appget-died/), its goal is to be a "one-stop shop" to install all your Windows programs. It achieves this by having a central repository of installation scripts for all of your favorite applications such as Discord, Spotify, and Steam. ~~Currently, Winget has to be manually installed, but later it should come bundled with Windows.~~
